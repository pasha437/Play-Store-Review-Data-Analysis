# Play-Store-Review-Data-Analysis
In this project work, we have analysed 2 datasets. A dataset of Play store applications information and a dataset of user reviews on applications. The Play store dataset has more than ten thousand entries and thirteen columns. 
The user review dataset has more than sixty-four thousand entries with five columns. Pre-process is to import relevant python packages and libraries and uploaded the datasets in our coding environment, making data frames with them. 
Then we tried to get some important information like shape, column names, null value existence, overall description and information using different methods. 
To get null value-free datasets, we started data manipulation by filling up the null value position with required values and converting the object type data type into proper formats like integer, float and DateTime. 
Then followed by the main analysis i.e. Visualisation which is used for a better understanding of datasets through some different kinds of plotting. 
In this part, we used different plots to get relational information among the columns, like Apps Vs Sentiments, Sentiment subjectivity and Sentiment polarity, Category-wise application count, correlation among the features, category Vs price etc. 
Using the python command, we also performed some other operations, thereby exploring the data sets given and coming to the respective conclusions.
